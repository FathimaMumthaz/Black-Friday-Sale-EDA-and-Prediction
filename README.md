# Black-Friday-Sale-EDA-and-Prediction

Black Friday is the biggest retail sales day in the United States, often regarded as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season. This season is crucial for the economy, especially for retailers. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season in the United States.


# Problem Statement
A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

In this project, I have used Python to apply various Machine Learning algorithms to predict Black Friday Sales. R2 Score and RMSE score were used to evaluate the model.

In this project, I have done:

- Data Cleaning

- Feature Selection

- Data Modeling

- Model Evaluation

For predicting the purchase of Black Friday, I have used algorithms like

- Linear Regression

- KNN Regression

- Decision Tree Regression

- Random Forest 

- XGB Regressor

FOr evaluating the model, I have used R2 score and RMSE score.

The best results were available in XGB Regressor.

To improvise the project, one can work with tuning the hyper parametrers. Also since the dataset is very large, one can apply neural networks to find the relationship between the features and labels and get a better model.
